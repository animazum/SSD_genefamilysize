Overview
This repository contains scripts and instructions used for the analysis presented in the article "Reduced Sexual Size Dimorphism Shapes Brain Development Gene Family Sizes in Mammals." The study explores gene family size expansion in relation to brain development and sexual size dimorphism in mammals.

Contents

-OrthofinderCDSDownload

Description: This directory includes all the necessary scripts and a comprehensive manual to guide users step-by-step on how to use Orthofinder with CDS (Coding DNA Sequence) data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

-Gene Family Size Expansion Analysis

Description: This folder contains the scripts used to perform the gene family size expansion analysis with Phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares (PGLS). To run this script, you will require orthologue gene counts obtained from Orthofinder.

-Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis

Description: The script in this folder is used to conduct Gene Ontology enrichment analysis. It takes the results from the PGLS analysis of gene family sizes as input and generates a heat map showing significantly enriched GO (Gene Ontology) categories associated with the focal phenotype.

-Tissue Gene Expression Analysis

Description: This directory provides scripts for two gene expression analyses. The first analysis utilizes human data to examine gene expression differences between various tissues in males, females, and fetuses. The second script performs a ranking analysis to assess different tissues' gene expression and determines the brain tissue's ranking compared to random permutations between males and females.

-Sex Biased Gene Expression

Description: This section includes a script for conducting fold change analysis between adult males, adult females, and prenatal stages using average brain gene expression.
